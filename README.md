## 2048 Game
> 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli.

The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, you can keep playing the game, creating tiles with larger numbers (such as a 32,768 tile).
